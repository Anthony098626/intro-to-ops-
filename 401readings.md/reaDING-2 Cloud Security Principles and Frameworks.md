    - The ;evels of abstraction in AWS is like a contractor to help you build a house except that house is a didgital computer. 
2) What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?
    - the controll plane is responsible for exposing the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and lifecycle containers. where as the data plane is responsible for providing capacity (as in CPU/Memory/Network/Storage) so that those containers can actually run and connect to a network.
3)Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?
    - it falls at the functioning level of abstraction and it is special casue Lambda is an execution environment that allows an AWS customer to run a single function.
