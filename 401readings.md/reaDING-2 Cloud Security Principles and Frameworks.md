# Compute Abstractions on AWS: A Visual Story
1) Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.
- The levels of abstraction in AWS is like a contractor to help you build a house except that house is a digital computer. 
2) What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?
- the control plane is responsible for exposing the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and life cycle containers. where as the data plane is responsible for providing capacity (as in CPU/Memory/Network/Storage) so that those containers can actually run and connect to a network.
3)Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?
- it falls at the functioning level of abstraction and it is special because Lambda is an execution environment that allows an AWS customer to run a single function.
