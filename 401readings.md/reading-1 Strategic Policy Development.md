# The ultimate guide to SOC 2 compliance
1) How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?
- I would inform them that being SOC2 compliant is industry standard, and it will help build trust with present and future clients by demonstrating our commitment to protecting there data. 
2) What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?
- the five SOC2 principals are Privacy, security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality. 
3) How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?
- I would explain the SOC2 pyramid to my friends in the terms of gun safety policy's. The bottom layer, the foundation of it all "Security policy's / what you do" would be like the basic principals of handling and maintaining a firearm. The middle layer of the SOC2 pyramid the execution portion of it "security procedures / how you do it". This would be the application process of it such as proper storage, handling and training. And final the top layer the proof layer "supporting doc's / proof you did it". This is like getting firearm safety licenses and certifications.
