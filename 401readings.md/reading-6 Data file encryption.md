# Applying The CIA Triad To Your Enterprise File Transfer
1) You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad?
    - To preserve the 3 elements of the CIA triad for the company I would preserve confidentiality by Implementing strong authentication, data encryption, access control, and conduct regular security audits.  For integrity I would Use data validation, checksums/digital signatures, version control, and deploy an intrusion detection and prevention system.  And for accoountability I would ensure redundancy, establish backup/disaster recovery plans, use load balancing, and perform monitoring and maintenance. 
2) Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms.
    - Hashing converts data into a unique code. Comparing codes checks if data is unchanged.
3) How is hashing and encryption different?
    - hashing and encryption are diffrent because hashing is used for veryfying data integrity and ensuring data hasnt been tampered with.  where as encryption is used for securing data confidentiality, ensuring only authorized parties can access the data.
