# What is a site to site VPN? 
A site to site VPN aka "router to router" is a type of VPN that allows two or more geographically separte networks to securily connet with eachother over the internet.  Ultimatly it is connecting the routers of two or more networks to create a secure connection between them.  This is usefull for companies that take presidance over security, as it is usefull for companies that are spread out over the country.  Site to site VPN's use encrution and tunneling protocals to create a secure connection between the two networks.  Thee data is encrypted so it cant be intercepted by other parties.  Also the VPN will create a virtual tunnel between the two networks so it appears that theyb are directly connected.
