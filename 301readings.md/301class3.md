# CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes
CIDER "classless inter-domain routing" block notation is a way of represnting IP address ranges in a computer.  CIDER notations are used to quickly alloccate and manage IP addresses, by allowing more flexibility in the size of the network blocks that can be assigned.

### CIDR Block Notation Explained in 2 Minutes
    1)What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block?
        -CIDR notation is a shorthand method for representing an IP address and its associated network mask in a compact and standardized form. A CIDR block is a range of IP addresses that share a common network prefix.
    2)How many octets are found in an IPv4 address?
        - there are four octets in an IPv4 address
    3)Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet?
        - The range of numbers found in octect range from 0-255. 
    4)What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address?
        - The final digit after the slash (/) in an IPv4 address represents the number of bits in the network mask for the address.  
    5)How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24?
        - The CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24 includes all IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255.
### What Is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters?
    1) In your own words, describe network segmentation.
        - Network segmentation is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable subnetworks, called segments or subnets.
    2) Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not?
        - i do not agree cause there could be a bad actor working inside. 
    3) What is a screened subnet?
        - this is a network architecture that provides an additional layer of security for a network.
    4) Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
        - these are examples of physical security measures.
