# Network Address Translation (NAT)

This is a way to share one internet connection between multiple devices in a private network.  With NAT, each device on the private network is given a unique IP address so they can communicate with the internet, but they all appear to have the same public IP address to the outside world. This allows multiple devices to share a single internet connection without each device needing its own public IP address.
