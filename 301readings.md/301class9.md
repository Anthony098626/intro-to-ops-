# How to capture network traffic ? SPAN vs TAP

SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer) and TAP (Test Access Point) are two different methods for capturing network traffic for analysis or monitoring purposes.

* What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?
  * both are used for monotoring network traffic and analysys but SPAN is a software-based feature of network switches that copies traffic to a single monitoring port, while TAP is a physical device that duplicates traffic from a network segment.

* What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?
    -some types of network devices that can support monotoring network traffic are switches, routers, firewalls, network TAP's "test access points", NIC's network interface cards. Switches are the mos common of these examples.

* How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?
    - Network traffic mirroring can be used for network security in several ways such as intrution and malware detection, forensic analysis, compliance monotoring, and network performacne monotoring. 

* Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?
    - Yes, there are legal and ethical considerations that must be taken into account when using network traffic mirroring such as privacy, consent, data retention, security and employee monotoring.
